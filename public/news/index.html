                <p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently developed strong persuasive capabilities that outperform humans in head-to-head comparisons. With users consulting LLMs about major life decisions in relationships, medical contexts, and when seeking professional advice, there is a need to understand its nuanced behaviors in these contexts. With that in mind, I am currently working with <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/tmitra/">Professor Tanu Mitra</a> and <a href="https://nicholasclark.org/">Nicholas Clark</a> through the <a href="https://dub.uw.edu/reu.html">DUB REU Program</a> to research LLM persuasive techniques in multiturn naturalistic conversations, exploring differences in behaviors across models, user message types, and conversation topics.</p>

                <p>Empathic communication is an interpersonal skill that can transform a conversation from a mere information exchange into a meaningful human connection. Recent empirical studies have demonstrated large language models (LLMs) have the capability to identify instances of empathic communication and even express empathy, but their performance depends on the conversational context. We investigate the inter-rater reliability of experts, crowds, and LLMs for empathic communication by comparing annotations of 21 empathy-related features in 200 conversations across four datasets where one partner is sharing a problem and the other is offering empathetic support. We aimed to answer the questions: How reliable are annotations of empathic communication from crowds and LLMs relative to experts? How does this differ across sub-components of empathic communication How do annotations of empathic communication differ across different types of LLM models and prompting techniques?

                <p>What does it mean to empathize with a person? While recent research has revealed that large language models (LLMs) can sometimes express empathy more effectively than humans, people still feel less heard when they know a message was AI-generated. These findings reveal the human need for emotional connection from other humans, presenting an opportunity to leverage LLMs’ capacity to help improve people’s empathic communication rather than trying to replace it. Motivated by this potential, we investigated: How does people’s empathy expression change when receiving different forms of feedback? What is a justified framework for evaluating empathic expressions? What reactions do people have when receiving AI-generated feedback on their empathic communication? I had the opportunity to <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTqvmuKrSZqnImqhQ1_m163JKEr03AzA-scW7iRxw4UUrZJF4Otl5D4qIE_bwQXey0Gf52RCUohO8HL/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000">present the findings</a> of our pilot study for this project at the <a href="https://www.caurs.com/">Chicago Undergraduate Research Symposium, 2025.</a></p>
