    <h2>Launched BWF Badminton World Rankings Analysis Website</h2>
    <p class = "date">June 10th, 2024</p>
    <p> I developed a <a href="https://k4x6kv-fai-poungpeth.shinyapps.io/final-project/">website</a> which provides users with the ability to custom analyze badminton world ranking data. It was a personal project for me to explore data visualization techniques using R. The website contains three core features: a map for users to see the distribution of the top 100 players from 2013-2023, a line chart for users to compare the rankings of any two top players from 2022-2023, and a stacked bar plot for users to see the distribution of top 50 players across disciplines for a specified country.</p>

    <h2>Investigating Individual Differences in Block Assembly Strategies Presentation</h2>
    <p class = "date">April 18th - 20th & May 23rd, 2024</p>
    <p> The block design task is a common assessment for spatial ability, where participants use 3D colored blocks to recreate 2D designs presented to them. I investigated specific strategies which undergraduate students used to perform this task, and created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQx-U-SVAA-PDlUscCI9A1LfNgqXIsfhITx1htGcj3xNdeeA2I6DfncziJ_VclmXA/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.p1">poster</a> to present my findings at the <a href = "https://midwesternpsych.org/">Midwest Psychological Association Conference 2024</a> and the Northwestern University <a href="https://undergradresearch.northwestern.edu/share/expo/">Undergraduate Research and Arts Exposition 2024</a>.</p>

    <h2>Cognitive Science SURF Grant Recipient</h2>
    <p class = "date">April 17th, 2024</p>
    <p>I received a $4000 research grant through the Northwestern University Cognitive Science department's <a href="https://cogsci.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/surf.html">Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship</a> program. I researched how large language model role playing games can be used to help people improve their empathic communication. In particular, I focused on developing a comprehensive framework for evaluating the quality of empathic expressions, and designed an experiment for measuring whether these skills transferred to in-person interactions. I will be presenting the findings of this project to cognitive science students and faculty in May 2025.</p>

    <h2>Fletcher Undergraduate Research Grant Nominee</h2>
    <p class = "date">September 28th, 2023</p>
    <p>The Fletcher Undergraduate Research Grant acknowledges the most outstanding research projects conducted by Northwestern students each summer. Students who are nominated for this award tend to have demonstrated significant accomplishment, highlighting their intelligence, creativity, and dedication. I am honored to have been nominated for this award by my faculty sponsor, who I conducted research with in summer 2023.</p>

    <h2>Prioritizing the Ethical Dimensions of Computer Science Article Feature</h2>
    <p class = "date">May 19th, 2023</p>
    <p>I was featured in an <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/news-events/news/articles/2023/prioritizing-the-ethical-dimensions-of-computer-science.html">article</a> published by Northwestern University's computer science department, after working with the NU Tech Ethics Initative to incorporate ethics into Northwestern University's computer science curriculum. In particular, the article discusses our work to incorporate ethics modules into the course content for <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/embeddingethics/examples/northwestern/comp-sci-111/">Fundamentals of Computer Science I</a> and <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/embeddingethics/examples/northwestern/comp-sci-214/">Data Structures and Algorithms</a>.</p>

    <h2>Summer Undergraduate Research Grant 2023 Recipient</h2>
    <p class = "date">April 12th, 2023</p>
    <p>I received a $4000 research grant through the Northwestern University Office of Undergraduate Research's <a href="https://undergradresearch.northwestern.edu/funding/surg/">Summer Undergraduate Research Grant program.</a> I researched the relationship between undergraduate students' abilities to perform the block design task, which is used to measure spatial cognition, and their global vs local processing. In addition, I also investigated the similarities and differences in spatial assembly patterns which children and undergraduate students used.</p>
