    Launched BWF Badminton World Rankings Analysis Website
    June 10th, 2024
     I developed a website which provides users with the ability to custom analyze badminton world ranking data. It was a personal project for me to explore data visualization techniques using R. The website contains three core features: a map for users to see the distribution of the top 100 players from 2013-2023, a line chart for users to compare the rankings of any two top players from 2022-2023, and a stacked bar plot for users to see the distribution of top 50 players across disciplines for a specified country.">
